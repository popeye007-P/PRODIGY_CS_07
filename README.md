# Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy Infotech

## Overview
This repository contains projects developed during my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech. The internship focused on practical applications of cybersecurity principles including network analysis, password security, and keylogging. These projects reflect my understanding and hands-on experience in building security tools and analyzing network traffic.

## Projects

### 1. PRODIGY_implement_caesar_chiper_01.py
A Python script implementing the classic Caesar cipher for simple encryption and decryption. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of symmetric key encryption.

### 2. PRODIGY_Network_packet_analyzer_05.py
A network packet sniffer and analyzer built using Scapy to capture and inspect IP packets. It extracts and displays source and destination IPs, protocol types, and payload data, aiding in network security analysis.

### 3. PRODIGY_Password_Complexity_Checker_03.py
A tool to evaluate password strength based on complexity criteria such as length, use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters, ensuring adherence to security best practices.

### 4. PRODIGY_simple_keylogger_04.py
A basic keylogger developed for educational purposes to record keystrokes and log them to a file, highlighting ethical considerations involved in monitoring inputs.

## Usage
Each project is a standalone Python script. Ensure you have Python installed along with any necessary libraries (e.g., Password Complexity Checker.).

## Ethical Considerations
All projects involving monitoring or data capture were developed strictly for educational purposes in controlled environments with appropriate permissions. Responsible and ethical use of cybersecurity tools is paramount.
